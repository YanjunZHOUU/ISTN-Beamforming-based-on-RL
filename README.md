# ISTN-Beamforming-based-on-RL

Beamforming Schemes for Integrated Satellite- Terrestrial Networks Based on Reinforcement Learning. 

Author: Yanjun Zhou

This repository includes all the code for both static and dynamic topology scenarios. The basic ISTN model used is modified from the paper by Du et.al [1]. The study experimented with four reinforcement learning algorithms: SAC, DDPG, TD3, and PPO. Our report selected the most representative ones, SAC and DDPG, for presentation.

To run any of the algorithms, run the corresponding main scrpit.
